These firmware versions use UARP Super Binaries, which require [`uarp-dump`](https://github.com/19h/uarp-dump) to extract the FTAB file from the UARP Super Binary before processing with `ftab-dump`:

#### Notes

If you intend to analyze `rkos` files, note that the AirPods Pro 1, 2 and 3 use an Arm Cortex-M4 32-bit RISC CPU with VFPv4 and ThumbV2 instructions using the ARMv7-M architecture with a little endian byte sex.
